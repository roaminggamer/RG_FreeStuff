# 001 UniPong
No-player pong made with [SSK2](https://roaminggamer.github.io/RGDocs/pages/SSK2/) and Corona SDK.

This game plays itself to demonstrate basic AI.

+ Same mechanics as '001 UniPong'
+ Basic AI that moves paddle


##Requires SSK2
This example requires that you own [SSK2](https://roaminggamer.github.io/RGDocs/pages/SSK2/) (lite or PRO) version 008 or later.

##Before You Start
Once you purhcase and download [SSK2](https://roaminggamer.github.io/RGDocs/pages/SSK2/), unzip the file and,

+ Copy ~/extras/images/ folder here.
+ Copy ~/extras/sounds/ folder here.
+ Copy ~/extras/factories/ folder here.
+ Copy ~/ssk2/ folder here

Now you are ready to run the example in the simulator.


##Why Am I providing this?
I found that new [Corona SDK](https://coronalabs.com/) community members often encounter many of the same problems and that the foundation of these problems originated in a lack of experience.  

This is not a bad thing.  It is simply the way things are.  New developers come into a community and their first instinct is to make their favorite game or the current hot game.  

As you would imagine, many quickly become stuck and frustrated.  

It is my firm belief that all 2D game developers should learn a common set of base concepts *AND* should make a common set of 'fundamental' games.  

Having a conviction is great, but action is better.  So, I decided that as time permits, I will provide 'fundamental' game samples and training materials demonstrating key principles.  This is one of those samples/games.

##Not The Only Solution
_I want to point out that this is one of many possible ways of implementing the example/game._  There is no single right way.  However, hope that this helps new developers by demonstrating some fundamental concepts and mechanics.



##What are these batch files?
Sorry! You can ignore these.  They are for my benefit as I develop examples.

prepj.bat and prepjlite.bat are batch files I use to create junctions (symbolic links) to the folders you just copied into this project.  

I use symbolic links to simply my dev work and to avoid having duplicate copies of [SSK2](https://roaminggamer.github.io/RGDocs/pages/SSK2/) and the assets all over the place.
